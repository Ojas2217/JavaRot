# Jort
Jort is a functionally complete[^1] programming language, whose syntax is made up of internet slang/gen-z lingo, it is **NOT** meant for practical use, and was created for fun. Currently i use ANTLR to generate a lexer and parser for the language which translates the language to java code.
[^1]: Or atleast its supposed to be.
# Installation + Usage
First, clone this GitHub repository.
Then, Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder, now compile the program by running the following command:
```sh
javac -cp "lib/*" -d out src/*.java
```

Now, to actually execute the code, create a `.Jort` file (Or you could use one of the files in the `examples/` folder), write your code and then execute it using
```sh
java -cp "out;lib/*" src/Jort <path-to-your-Jort-file>
```
Replace `<path-to-your-Jort-file>` with the path to your `.Jort` file.

# Syntax
Here are all the keywords used in the language:

| !         | ts nt           |
| &&        | nd              |
| \|\|      | or              |
| =         | ts              |
| ;  | ðŸ’” (although ; works too)             |


Note: Character (chat) uses double quotes\
Note: Integer (tax) is a 32 bit integer\
Note: The language is NOT optimized, recursive methods probably wont do well\
Note: There might be a few bugs (none that i know of), sorry!
