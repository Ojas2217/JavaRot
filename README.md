# JavaRot
JavaRot is a functionally complete[^1] programming language, whose syntax is made up of internet slang/gen-z lingo, it is **NOT** meant for practical use, and was created for fun. Currently i use ANTLR to generate a lexer and parser for the language[^2] which translates the language to java code, making this a fancy way to code in java.
[^1]: Or atleast its supposed to be.
[^2]: I plan to update it with my own lexer and parser in the future
# Installation + Usage
More on this soon. ;)
